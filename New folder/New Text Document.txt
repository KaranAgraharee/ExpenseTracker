Project Overview: Full-Stack Expense Tracker
1. Project Introduction (30 seconds)
"I built a comprehensive full-stack expense tracking application that helps users manage their personal and group expenses. It's a complete solution with user authentication, group management, contact tracking, and detailed expense analytics."
2. Technical Architecture (1-2 minutes)
Frontend:
React 19 with Vite for fast development and building
Redux Toolkit for state management across 8 different slices (user, expenses, groups, contacts, bills, budgets, etc.)
React Router for navigation between landing page, authentication, and main app
Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI design
React Hook Form for form validation and management
Backend:
Node.js with Express.js framework
MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for database operations
JWT authentication with secure cookie-based sessions
Nodemailer for email functionality
CORS configured for cross-origin requests
bcryptjs for password hashing
3. Key Features (2-3 minutes)
Core Functionality:
User Authentication & Authorization
Secure JWT-based login/signup
Password hashing with bcrypt
Protected routes with middleware
Expense Management
Create, read, update, delete expenses
Support for both individual and group expenses
Real-time expense tracking with date/time stamps
Automatic expense linking to contacts
Group Management
Create and manage expense groups
Add/remove members from groups
Track group-specific expenses
Group expense analytics
Contact System
Manage contacts with detailed expense breakdowns
Track both group and non-group expenses per contact
Search and filter contacts
Real-time spending summaries
Dashboard & Analytics
Monthly expense comparisons
Total spending calculations
Net balance tracking (money owed vs. owed to you)
Recent expense history
Budget tracking and management
Bill Management
Create and track bills
Bill splitting functionality
Payment status tracking
4. Database Design (1 minute)
"I designed a MongoDB schema with 5 main models:
Users: Authentication, budget, total spending
Expenses: Items, prices, dates, members, groups
Groups: Group management and member tracking
Contacts: Relationship management with expense linking
Bills: Bill creation and payment tracking
The relationships are well-structured with proper referencing and automatic total calculations."
5. Security & Best Practices (1 minute)
JWT tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
Password hashing with bcrypt
CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
Input validation with Joi
Environment variables for sensitive data
Error handling with try-catch blocks
Middleware-based authentication for route protection
6. Deployment & DevOps (30 seconds)
Vercel deployment configuration for both frontend and backend
MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
Environment-based configuration for different deployment stages
Build optimization with Vite for production
7. Challenges Solved (1-2 minutes)
"Some key challenges I solved:
Complex state management: Used Redux Toolkit to manage 8 different slices efficiently
Real-time expense linking: Implemented automatic contact-expense relationship updates
Authentication flow: Created secure JWT-based auth with proper middleware
Responsive design: Built mobile-first UI with Tailwind CSS
Data consistency: Ensured proper database relationships and automatic calculations"
8. Code Quality & Architecture (1 minute)
Modular structure: Separated concerns with controllers, models, routes, and middleware
ES6+ features: Used modern JavaScript with async/await, destructuring, and modules
Error handling: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
Clean code: Well-organized file structure and naming conventions
Scalable architecture: Easy to extend with new features
9. Future Enhancements (30 seconds)
"Areas for improvement include:
Real-time notifications
Data visualization with charts
Export functionality for reports
Mobile app development
Advanced filtering and search"
10. Demo Points to Highlight
Show the landing page and authentication flow
Demonstrate expense creation (both individual and group)
Show the dashboard with analytics
Display contact management and expense tracking
Highlight the responsive design on different screen sizes
